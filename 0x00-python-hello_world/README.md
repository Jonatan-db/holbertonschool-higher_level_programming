Why Python programming is awesome (don’t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #pythoniscool :))
Python is awesome because of all the things it lets lazy people bypass. Shell scripts are good for moving files and changing text data but not for GUI purposes. Python is available for all OS and gets poop done fast. Offers tons of error checking, built-ins, modules, is an interpreted language, readable, extensible, 

Who created Python
Someone who loved Monty Python's Flying circus, apparently. Guido van Rossum, 1991.

Who is Guido van Rossum
A genius who wanted something to do for a week around Christmas. So he wrote his own language what is similar to ABC. He is the BDFL, benevolent dictator for life, and he was the king of Python until 2018. He is Dutch. He wrote Python while working at CWI, the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica. 

Where does the name ‘Python’ come from
Monty Python's Flying Circus. British sketch comedy series. 

What is the Zen of Python
A collection of software principles. It makes a very nice poem by Tim Peters.

How to print text and variables using print
Add r before first quote to not interpret \.

How to use strings
Easy! It's Python. Python strings are immutable. Cannot reassign indexed characters. Also .format() and {}.

What are indexing and slicing in Python
Indexing is index, which means subscripted. Strings can be indexed. Negative indexing is supported. Indexing is to obtain 1 character and slicing is to get a substring using the format [index#ofStart:#beforeIndex#ofend]. [included:excluded].

What is the official Holberton Python coding style and how to check your code with PEP 8
The Holberton Python style is oeo8, version 1.7.*. Pycodestyle is the Python standard and based on pep8.
