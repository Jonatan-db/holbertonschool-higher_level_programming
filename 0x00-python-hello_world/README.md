Why Python programming is awesome (don’t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #pythoniscool :))
Python is awesome because of all the things it lets lazy people bypass. Shell scripts are good for moving files and changing text data but not for GUI purposes. Python is available for all OS and gets poop done fast. Offers tons of error checking, built-ins, modules, is an interpreted language, readable, extensible,

How to use strings
Easy! It's Python. Python strings are immutable. Cannot reassign indexed characters. Also .format() and {}.

Indexing is index, which means subscripted. Strings can be indexed. Negative indexing is supported. Indexing is to obtain 1 character and slicing is to get a substring using the format [index#ofStart:#beforeIndex#ofend]. [included:excluded].
