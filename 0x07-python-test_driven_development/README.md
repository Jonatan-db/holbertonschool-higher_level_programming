Whatâ€™s an interactive test
Interactive tests are used to test a module docstrings are up to date. 
Doctest. Docstrings. Execution, handling exceptions, option flags.


Why tests are important
Cause hackzorz and bugs are evil. Why are case studies and trails needed for drugs? Why is any testing of a completed building done? R u srs.
But no, all seriousness, working in fintech, can't lose all your money. In other fields, privavyand data is big. Security. Reliabilty. Quality. Maintenance. Efficiency/ performance. Failures are more expensive in later stages in development. Buisness.
