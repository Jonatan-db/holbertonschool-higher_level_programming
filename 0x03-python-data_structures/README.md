What are lists and how to use them
Lists are simply arrays but you can store different data tyoes. You should use them like how you would use an array. In python, many built-in functions exist, you can do negative indexing, and there are lots of support for lists. 

What are the differences and similarities between strings and lists
Strings are immutable. Both can be sliced. Both can be concatenated. Both create copies. You can nest lists. You can't nest a string in a string in a string.

What are the most common methods of lists and how to use them
len() and index() and remove() and sort() copy() and reverse(), etc.

How to use lists as stacks and queues
pop() and append() and extend(), etc.
from collections import deque. use append, popleft, que, deque.

What are list comprehensions and how to use them
A concise way to create lists. Instead of 3 lines to make an array that stores squares of numbers, we can do this squares = [x\*\*2 for x in range(10)].
Basically start with a bracket, expression, for loop, then more for or ifs after.

What are tuples and how to use them
Tuples need to be parethesized. Tuples returns multiple resuklts. They are immutable. They are nice keys for dictionaries. Use them if there are constant structures and different types. Lists are useful for homogeneous values.

When to use tuples versus lists
If you really want to guarentee the consumer isnt altering anything, use a tuple.

What is a sequence
A generic term for an ordered set. Lists, Tuples, and Strings.

What is tuple packing
Pack, unpack, compare, slicing, delete, key. Packing together values.
Placing value into a new tuple while unpacking and extracting those back into variables.
eg. x = ("Guru99", 20, "Education")    # tuple packing

What is sequence unpacking
(company, emp, profile) = x    # tuple unpacking

What is the del statement and how to use it
Remove an item from a list given the index instead of the value. Remove removes by value. del can remove slices or clear an entire list or even variables.
